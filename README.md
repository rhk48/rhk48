🇰🇷 [Time Series Analysis of Air Pollution in Seoul, South Korea](https://github.com/rhk48/Time-Series-Analysis-of-Seouls-Air-Pollution)
- Collected 650,000 data points across 25 districts of the daily average of each pollutant level.
- Feature Engineered to filter for areas that reach levels of extremely dangerous pollutants
- Studied the World Health Organization’s standards of such pollutant and filtered further
- Modeled over the top 5 districts with the highest pollutants and predicted levels for days later in the interest of public health concerns.

- Filtered and calculated annual return rate to find the top five zip codes with the highest return rate in Texas.
- Forecasted values for the top five zip codes through filtering and Time Series Modeling. 

🚗 [Predictive Modeling of Car Crashes in Chicago](https://github.com/rhk48/chicago-cars) 
- Feature engineered and filtered to enhance model performance and hone in on relevant functions.
