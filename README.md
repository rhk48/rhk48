### Projects 📊
🇰🇷 [Time Series Analysis of Air Pollution in Seoul, South Korea](https://github.com/rhk48/Time-Series-Analysis-of-Seouls-Air-Pollution)
- Collected 650,000 data points across 25 districts of the daily average of each pollutant level.
- Feature Engineered to filter for areas that reach levels of extremely dangerous pollutants
- Studied the World Health Organization’s standards of such pollutant and filtered further
- Modeled over the top 5 districts with the highest pollutants and predicted levels for days later in the interest of public health concerns. 

🛏️ [Zillow Real Estate Analysis](https://github.com/rhk48/zillow-time-series) 
- Obtained home values per zipcode from Zillow’s website from the years of 1996-2018.
- Filtered and calculated annual return rate to find the top five zip codes with the highest return rate in Texas.
- Forecasted values for the top five zip codes through filtering and Time Series Modeling. 

🚗 [Predictive Modeling of Car Crashes in Chicago](https://github.com/rhk48/chicago-cars) 
- Feature engineered and filtered to enhance model performance and hone in on relevant functions.  
- Create a series of models through grid searches, cross-validation in logistic regressions, random forests, decision trees, and xgboost classifiers to find the most optimized model.  
- Filtered for proper feature priorities from models to inquiry what factors best predicted severe crashes and fatalities in Chicago.
